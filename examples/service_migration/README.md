# Service Migration Example #

This example shows a simple service migration using ComNetsEmu.
The following figure depicts the setup:

```text
H1 --------- H2
      |
      |----- H3
```

While the client application is deployed on h1, the service application is firstly deployed on host h2.
The client application simply sends dummy UDP packets to the service address: 10.0.0.12:8888 every second and waits for
the response from the service application.
The service application simply perform a counting operation and return the number of packets received from the client.
The service application will be migrated between h2 and h3.
The state of the latest value of the counter is transmitted between h2 and h3 via their internal data network, which is
in a different subnet from the service address: 192.168.0.0/24.
So h2 and h3 has two interfaces up: one for service traffic and another one for state traffic between them.
Please check `./topology.py` for details.

## Run the emulation

Please first build the Docker image named `service_migration` with:

```bash
$ sudo ./build_docker_images.sh
```
Then the emulation script can be executed with:

```bash
$ sudo python3 ./topology.py
```

An example of the output:

```bash
- Internal IP of h2: 192.168.0.12
- Internal IP of h3: 192.168.0.13
PING 10.0.0.12 (10.0.0.12): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.0.0.12: seq=0 ttl=64 time=204.414 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.12: seq=1 ttl=64 time=47.904 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.12: seq=2 ttl=64 time=40.560 ms

--- 10.0.0.12 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 40.560/97.626/204.414 ms
